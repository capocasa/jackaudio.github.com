This release focuses on bug fixes, particularly interesting for users might be macOS 12 compatibility.

The official JACK2 changelog is:

* Fix potential memory corruption in midi_latency_test tool
* Fix JackWeakAPI on Windows
* Use predefined variables in pkg-config file (required for mingw)

External changes, related to macOS/Windows installer:
* Fix application style in QJackCtl (qwindowsvistastyle.dll was missing)
* Update QjackCtl used in macOS/Windows installers to 0.9.7
