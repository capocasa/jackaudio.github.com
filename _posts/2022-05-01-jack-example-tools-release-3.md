A new release of the new [jack-example-tools](https://github.com/jackaudio/jack-example-tools) project is out.  
This is version 3 which only contains bugfixes.

Changelog:

- Ensure internal clients export their function entry points
- Fix macOS and Windows builds

As noted in the previous release, please be aware that the JACK2 project is only going to ship with similar tools (as in, have them built-in) for 1 more release.  
See the [original jack-example-tools announcement](https://jackaudio.org/news/2022/01/15/jack-example-tools-release-1.html) for details.
